								We'll Untangle Your Organisational Spaghetti.
							</h1>
							<p>
								👋 We’re a not-for-profit worker co-op of strategists, innovators, and facilitators. We design and deliver strategies and tactics to untangle your organisational spaghetti by working hand-in-hand with you and your team, helping everyone learn where to intervene in complex systems.
							</p>
							<p>
								We’ve partnered with plenty of companies, charities, and non-profits that you (and perhaps more importantly, your boss) have heard of. Here’s a few of them:

								<img src="images/logos-white.png" alt="logos-white" data-position="center center">
							</p>
							<p>
								We don’t just think outside the box; we shred it (and then recycle it, obviously). Our services include consultancy, workshops and training, project and product management, research and development, community building, and everything in between.
							</p>
							<p>
								We thrive on working with purpose-driven organisations that value environmental sustainability, social responsibility, equality, and human rights. Based in the UK and Germany, we believe in making things better, together.
