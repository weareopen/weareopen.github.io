    	<h3>Rules</h3>
		<p>Armed with open minds, we gather to think. We must focus on the problems at hand. To ensure an equitable and just Thinkathon for all participants, We Are Open Co-op asks that each individual: </p>
		<ul class="lists">
			<li><strong>Be present.</strong> Life is messy, we know. Please take calls and do your emails outside the room.</li>
			<li><strong>Speak up</strong> if you have something to share. Say out loud when it's necessary to look at screens and when not.</li>
			<li><strong>Make room</strong> for everyone to speak. Pause and invite remote thinkers into the conversation. It's hard to be on the screen.</li>
			<li><strong>Know how</strong> decisions will be made. Discuss in advance who will make decisions. Or is it consensus-based? Take a few minutes to let your co-thinkers know. This will help when knotty issues arise.</li>
			<li><strong>Stay together</strong>, use a "Yes, and..." approach.</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>Tools</h3>
		<p>We load our kits with tools of the trade. Technology empowers us, and it changes the way we get things done. For remote Thinkathons, we use:
</p>
		<ul class="lists">
			<li><strong>Collaborative documents</strong>, such as Etherpad / Google Docs. These hold the Thinkathon Agenda, serve as a place to take notes, and in some cases, a backchannel chat to make jokes or to solve technical problems. <em>Meanwhile in the backchannel, Laura writes 'I can't hear you! Move the mic closer!'</em></li>
			<li><strong>Photo-sharing</strong>, such as uploading to a document or facing a computer towards a whiteboard. Google Slides work too.
</li>
			<li><strong>Video conferencing</strong>, we can use your solution or offer a room in a tool like Zoom or Appearin. Remote attendees and We Are Open members will appear on your screen. We'll organize the specific tool together in advance.</li>
			<li><strong>Document camera.</strong> We have this special tool to draw ideas that you can see in real time, no matter where we are in the world.</li>
			<li><strong>Stationery</strong> - paper, super-sticky post-its, pens: Have plenty of paper, post-its and pens for individual and collaborative thinking activities.
</li>
		</ul>
    	<h3>Room specs</h3>
		<p>Creativity needs space. Be sure you have a comfortable room where you can move the chairs and sit together in a half-circle. Your remote participants need to see everyone, which means your positioning in the room and lighting is important.</p>
		<ul class="lists">
			<li><strong>Table:</strong> A square or circular table is best.</li>
			<li><strong>Seating:</strong> A half circle will allow you to put laptops in front of the group. </li>
			<li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Ensure there is Internet, power and good lighting. </li>
			<li><strong>Wall space:</strong> A place to draw and stick post-its is very useful.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Tech check</h3>
		<p>Technology has a habit of going wrong, especially at a distance, so...a few days before our Thinkathon, we'll schedule a quick tech check. We'll ask you to meet us using the actual set-up you plan to use for the day. We'll have a quick fifteen minute chat to check the audio and visuals.</p>
		<h4>Audio:</h4>
		<ul class="lists">
			<li>Have an external microphone, or use a secondary laptop in the center of the table (be sure to mute the other laptops!) Virtual participants should use headphones. (Image of Dr. Echo)</li>
			<li>Check sound levels, and make it easy for remote participants to say when it's difficult to hear.</li>
			<li>Default to muted when you're not speaking, there's always unexpected sounds to distract people :)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Video:</h4>
		<ul class="lists">
			<li>We recommend two computers. On one you can fullscreen the virtual participants and on the other you can full screen the collaborative documents or document camera.
</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Power ups</h3>
		<p>Don't forget about energy levels, the brain needs a lot of juice! Have snacks and drinks available to help people think, and schedule breaks every 90 minutes (don't worry, we'll remind you!)</p>
		
		<h3>Final word</h3>
		<p>Thinkathons are fun, interactive experiences that will squeeze your brain dry. The aim of this brief guide is to set you up for success based on our experience.</p>
