												<p style="text-align:left;">According to the <a href="https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles">International Co-operative Alliance</a>:</p>
												<blockquote  style="text-align:left;">A co-operative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.	<br><br>
												Co-operatives are based on the values of <strong>self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity</strong> and <strong>solidarity</strong>. In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.								</blockquote>
												<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative">Wikipedia</a> says:</p>
												<blockquote style="text-align:left;">A cooperative (also known as co-operative, co-op or coop) is an autonomous association of people united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled business.Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use their services (a consumer cooperative); by the people who work there (a worker cooperative); by the people who live there (a housing cooperative); hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions; multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs; and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives. It was estimated that in 2012 approximately one billion people were members of at least one cooperative and that the turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion – which, if they were to be a country, it would make them the seventh largest.</blockquote>

												<p  style="text-align:left;">Co-operatives adhere to the <a href="https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles">seven international principles of co-operation</a>, outlined below.

															<h3>1. Voluntary and Open Membership</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.</p>

														<header>
													 <h3>2. Democratic Member Control</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Co-operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.</p>

													<section>
														<header>
															<h3>3. Member Economic Participation</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.</p>

														<header>
															<h3>4. Autonomy and Independence</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.</p>

															<h3>5. Education, Training and Information</h3>
														</header>
														<p>Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.</p>
