# Changelog

### 8th April 2017

## 24th October 2015 - Outsource work section from config file

The configuration for the work section has been moved into it's own [file](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-artists-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/data/work.toml) to keep the config file itself smaller. The [setup](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-artists-theme/tree/dev#create-your-portfolio) hasn't change much.
