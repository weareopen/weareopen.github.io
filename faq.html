				<h1>Important questions.</h1>
				<h2>Is We Are Open ever closed?</h2>
				<p>Yes, actually. Our members prefer to eat mince pies and wear fuzzy socks for the later half of December. We are officially closed for a holiday break each year.</p>
				
				<h2>We are Open vs a horse-sized duck, who would win?</h2>
				<p>Hey John, could you answer this one?</p>
				
				<h2>Is the WAO website powered by green, blue, or pink energy?</h2>
				<p>Yes yes yes.</p>
				
				<h2>If you’re so open, then doesn’t that make you technically invisible?</h2>
				<p>This doesn’t even make sense…</p>
				
				<h2>What motto do WAO members live by?</h2>
				<p>Eat, drink and co-operate.</p>
				
				<h2>Are you all yogurt-knitting vegans?</h2>
				<p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/do-only-yogurt-knitting-vegans-start-co-operatives-e03f62b26c3f">Not all of us</a>, but then we also welcome both non-dairy and beginning arts-and-crafters too.</p>
				
				<h2>What is WAO’s favourite food?</h2>
				<p>Not Scotch Eggs 😉</p>
				
				<h2>Is WAO pocket-sized?</h2>
				<p>Our work fits in phones, but phones don’t fit in women’s pockets so it depends on if you’re wearing ladies pants or not.</p>
				
				<h2>Does WAO think they know everything?</h2>
				<p>It depends who we’re talking to. Officially: “Oh goodness no. We’re the first to admit that we know very, very little about all kinds of things.”</p>
			
				<h2>Does WAO have its own timezone?</h2>
				<p>No, because timezones don’t really exist. However, we regret that <a href="https://www.swatch.com/en-gb/internet-time.html">Swatch’s Internet Time</a> hasn’t caught on widely.</p>
				
				<h2>Who is on WAO’s Christmas card list?</h2>
				<p>We can’t tell you for GDPR reasons, sadly.</p>
				
				<h2>Are WAO’s members human, or are they dancer?</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIZdjT1472Y">Thinking-face emoji</a></p>
				
				<h2>Why is WAO giving away free stuff like courses? Isn’t that stupid?</h2>
				<p>Yeah, probably. But so is capitalism.</p>
				
				<h2>Who’s in charge here?</h2>
				<p>That’s a very interesting question which we will consider at our next meeting and report back accordingly. Or, at least, someone will. If we can decide who should do that in a timely manner.</p>
				
				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>Why not?</p>
				
				<h2>Is this section a blatant rip-off of the side of Oatly cartons?</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.oatly.com/en-gb">Obvs.</a></p>
				
				<h2>Do you have a podcast?</h2>
				<p>We refer to it internally as an “RSS-powered listening experience”, but <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">yes.</a></p>
				
				<h2>Is this whole section a comment on FAQs in general as being a needless construct which provides a sticking plaster for poor content design and information architecture?</h2>
				<p>Yes.</p>
				
				<h2>Suggest a question!</h2>
